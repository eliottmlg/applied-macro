[Warning: Some of the parameters have no value (chi_l, A) when using stoch_simul. If these parameters are not initialized in a
steadystate file or a steady_state_model-block, Dynare may not be able to solve the model. Note that simul, perfect_foresight_setup,
and perfect_foresight_solver do not automatically call the steady state file.]
