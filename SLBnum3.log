[Warning: Some of the parameters have no value (A) when using steady. If these parameters are not initialized
in a steadystate file or a steady_state_model-block, Dynare may not be able to solve the model. Note that
simul, perfect_foresight_setup, and perfect_foresight_solver do not automatically call the steady state file.]
